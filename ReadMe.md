# Task:
Developing a program that monitors the health of an airplane using PySpark in Python.
The airplane health data is collected from various sensors onboard the aircraft and is stored in a distributed file system in CSV format.
This program should read this data, process it using Apache Spark, and generate insights (visualize) about the airplane's health.

## Requirements:
### Data Source: 
- Utilize a sample dataset containing airplane health sensor readings in CSV format. 
Each row represents a reading from a sensor and contains information such as sensor ID, timestamp, type of reading, and the value recorded.

### Apache Spark Processing: 
- Use Apache Spark to read the CSV data, perform necessary transformations, and calculate relevant statistics.

### Health Monitoring Metrics:
- Implement functions to calculate key health monitoring metrics such as average sensor readings, maximum and minimum readings, trends over time, etc.

### Visualization:
- Visualize the calculated metrics using appropriate libraries. You can choose to display the metrics as simple console outputs or generate plots/charts for better visualization.

### Fault Detection: 
- Implement a basic fault detection mechanism to identify any abnormalities or outliers in the sensor readings. This can be done by setting thresholds and flagging any readings that deviate significantly from normal behavior.

### Documentation:
- Provide clear documentation (code comments in this case) explaining the structure of your code, how to run it, and any assumptions made during development.
